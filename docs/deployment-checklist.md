## Common Issues and Quick Fixes

### Build Failures
- **Issue**: Docker build fails
- **Fix**: Check Dockerfile syntax, ensure all files committed

### Memory Issues
- **Issue**: Application crashes with OOM
- **Fix**: Optimize memory usage, reduce concurrent operations

### Port Issues
- **Issue**: Port binding errors
- **Fix**: Ensure using `process.env.PORT`, check Railway port configuration

### Health Check Failures
- **Issue**: Health check endpoint not responding
- **Fix**: Verify `/health` endpoint implementation, check startup time

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow response times
- **Fix**: Optimize database queries, implement caching, reduce payload sizes
