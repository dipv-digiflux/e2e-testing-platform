## 🔧 Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Fixed Playwright Version Mismatch Issue

**Problem:** 
```
Error: browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1181/chrome-linux/headless_shell
║ Looks like Playwright Test or Playwright was just updated to 1.54.2. ║
║ Please update docker image as well.                                  ║
║ -  current: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy               ║
║ - required: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.2-jammy               ║
```

**Solution:**
- Updated `Dockerfile` to use the correct Playwright version: `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.54.2-jammy`
- Added version compatibility check in pre-deployment script
- This ensures the Docker image matches the Playwright version in `package.json`

**Files Changed:**
- `Dockerfile` - Updated base image version
- `scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh` - Added version compatibility check

### 2. Added Test Report Delete Functionality

**New Feature:** Users can now delete test reports from the Test Reports page.

**What's New:**
- **DELETE API Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/report/:testId`
- **Delete Button:** Added to Test Reports interface
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Prevents accidental deletions
- **Complete Cleanup:** Removes test directories, zip files, and status tracking

**Files Changed:**
- `src/server.js` - Added DELETE endpoint
- `src/services/TestRunner.js` - Added `removeTestStatus()` method
- `public/reports.html` - Added delete button and JavaScript function

**API Usage:**
```bash
# Delete a test report
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/report/test-id-here
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "testId": "test-id-here",
  "message": "Test report deleted successfully",
  "deletedItems": ["test-run-directory", "zip-file", "test-status"]
}
```

- ✅ All required files and directories
- ✅ Playwright version compatibility
- ✅ Configuration file correctness
- ✅ Dependencies installation
- ✅ Server syntax validation

### 2. Test the Delete Functionality
1. Run some tests to generate reports
2. Go to `/reports` page
3. Click the "🗑️ Delete" button on any test

   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway following the guide:**
   - See `docs/railway-deployment-guide.md`

## 🔄 What's Next

- [ ] Automated cleanup policies (e.g., delete reports older than X days)
- [ ] Export functionality for test reports

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Pagination for large numbers of test reports
- [ ] Lazy loading of test report data
- [ ] Caching for frequently accessed reports

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter any issues:
